<h1>Search for info about any country</h1>
<p>This project aims to build a website with a search box where one can type in any country name and it will show several stats about that country including the current weather in the county's capital</p>
<br>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>This project bootstrappad by Create React app methode, and fetches info about the countries from https://restcountries.com/ , and weather info from https://api.openweathermap.org </p>
<br>
<h2>How to..?</h2>
<p>To run this, clone it into your perferred IDE, and run the command "npm start" in the command line, and it will launch locally on your computer</p>
<br>
<h2>Further improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Styling it... (Unfortunately, I'm not so in UI/UX stuff)</li>
  <li>Deploying it to the internet</li>
  <li>Small bug. When typing name of a country which is a part of a name of another country, it will not show the info about that country (unless you press the show button). For example, when typing 'Sudan' which is part of a name of 'South Sudan'</li>
  </ul>
